	This program uses one of many path finding algorithms. This one in particular is the A* path finding algorithm. The advantage that the A* algorithm has over other path finding algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm is that it uses a heuristic. A heuristic in this context is a prediction as to how far a particular node is to the end node.
